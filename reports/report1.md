## Meeting Schedule:

## Communication Plan: 
We will be using Discord to communicate with each other about project ideas and issues. We will be making decisions by ¾ majority because we only have 4 members. If we are behind or need help with whatever is assigned to us, we must reach out to our other members in advance so that the project can try to stay on track. 

## Project Idea:
We will be using HTML, JS, and CSS to create a website. We will be using GitHub as our version control system. We want to make a web application focused on college students and their finances. We want to create a service that can help them make a weekly/monthly budget and help them calculate potential repayment plans.
