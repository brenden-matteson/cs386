## 2. Retrospective  
Appreciations: Brenden completed a very well put together front of the website along with guidelines for how to continue with our development.  
Successes: Now have a working website front.  
Failures:   
Barriers: As a team, we do not have a completely thought out plan which is preventing us from a lot of implementation. However; this should come with time, especially with our deliverables moving us through the process.  
What we should try next time: Continue working towards having a clearer goal for the website.  
## 3. Next steps  
Makaela:  
* Work towards finishing deliverable 2.
* Start working on user stories and register them in github issues.
* Continue working on survey questions.
* Think about functional requirements.
  
Jered:
* Work on deliverable 2.
* Do research on how a person in their 20’s can create good credit score and put it in a new file in the repo for later use (this will later be implemented in the website)

Brenden:
* Work on deliverable 2.
* Continue development on the framework so as to help us test what kind of layout, conventions, and formatting we can majority agree to work with so that our project is easy to understand by everyone in the team.

Tyson:
* Work on deliverable 2
* Research equations and data samples on how to calculate total sums relating to what the client wants such as estimated annual salary, estimated debt, and estimated expenditures related to their spending habits.
