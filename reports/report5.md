## Retrospective

Appreciations: Jered has been doing a great job on working towards the information page of our website. Jered also put in a lot of extra work on our deliverable 2 when some of us were not available.

Successes: We completed our deliverable 2. 

Failures: We decided to turn in our deliverable 2 1 day late; however, we believe that we submitted a better deliverable.

Barriers: Makaela was sick this week making it harder to get as many things done

What we should try next time: Make sure to meet in person to have a more productive environment.
