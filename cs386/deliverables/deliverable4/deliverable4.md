## Deployment

https://brendenmatteson.com/archive/SimpleCents-web/ 

We are soft deploying our system on one of our member's personal website, to make it cheaper to host.

The website is hosted on DreamHost under the brendenmatteson.com domain.

## Licensing

MIT LICENSE, we chose this license because it best reflected our intentions with the website. It allows for others to contribute, modify, and distribute the website as they please.

## Readme File

All of our files are located in the root directory of the repository.

## UX Design

We looked at several other budgeting websites along with what current UX design looks like in practice. It is loosly related to how Apple does their widgets in that each major grouping of elements is a rounded rectangle with a drop shadow.

## Lessons Learned

The lessons we learned from the first release is that we need to start the implementation earlier because we were always behind schedule. For the second release we plan on starting earlier and creating a structured timeline so we are always on track for success.
